        <h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are going to investigate the performance of different implementations of mesh downsampling via quadratic error simplification on. We will focus on ways to efficiently collapse edges in parallel, while minimizing synchronization necessary to maintain the correctness of the data structure, and producting a high quality downsampling.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  Halfedge triangle meshes are used in computer graphics to represent surfaces in three dimensions. When a mesh has more vertices and edges than are necessary to effectively model a shape, downsampling can be used to collapse unnecessary edges. Although it is not possible to determine a completely optimized edge collapse order, the quadric error metric developed by Michael Garland and Paul Heckbert provides a heuristic to determine good edge collapse candidates. The basic algorithm computes a quadric error score for each edge and then uses a priority queue to iteratively collapse the edges with the best score. After each edge is collapsed, other edges may also be removed and the heuristic score for some edges may need to be updated. This introduces many opportunities for parallelism. Trivially, we can parallelize the computation of the quadric error scores for each edge. In addition, we will also collapse edges and update quadric error scores in parallel. This will require synchronization between threads to maintain correctness and provides an opportunity to test different work partitioning schemes.
</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>
  This problem is challenging since removing edges in a halfedge mesh in parallel requires synchronization so that a thread is not trying to traverse or remove edges that another thread has removed or edited. We will investigate the performance of different synchronization techniques including coarse-grained locks on the entire data structure, fine-grained locks on individual mesh elements, transactional memory operations, as well as lock free solutions that ensure that conflicting updates never occur. We will also investiage different work and spacial partitioning schemes, to ensure that synchronization between threads is relatively infrequent. Finally, traversing the halfedge data structure can have very incoherent memory access.
